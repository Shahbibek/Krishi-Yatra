# Introduction

## Purpose

SCM provides centralized control for the planning, design, manufacturing, inventory, and distribution phases required to produce and sell a company's products.

This project is developed to facilitate supply chain management to automate its operations of keeping records and storing them further facilitating easy access. The software is capable enough to allow the concerned person to store and retrieve any type of record with just a single click of the mouse. The software allows an Interactive, Self-describing User Interface environment where even standalone users can work very comfortably and efficiently. Data redundancy will be removed and will require a one-time investment only.

A goal of supply chain management is to improve efficiency by coordinating the efforts of the various entities in the supply chain. This can result in a company achieving a competitive advantage over its rivals and enhancing the quality of the products it produces, both of which can lead to increased sales and revenue.

#	User Classes and Characteristics

 

The users are Yatra’s employees, customers, Companies, and suppliers.


##	Operating Environment
-	The device must be of Android Operating System.
-	Android Smart Phones and Tablets with minimum version 5.1 and above



##	Design and Implementation Constraints

The system has many constraints. For example, the system must be android, and all tools must be compliant with android technologies, i.e., We must use Android and java as a programming language and Firebase, and SQL Lite as DBMS. We are also constrained by Yatra's framework and the system will later be integrated with the other two modules in the framework. Yatra has some programming standards that we must commit to.

##	User Documentation

Any user of the software system is the target audience for user documentation generated about the software system. A range of short document types (e.g., guidelines, tutorials, frequently asked questions) in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and/or Portable Document Format (PDF) format must describe the use of the software system.

##	Assumptions & Dependencies 

We assume that the server machine of the system has a suitable Android OS. The system must have a connection to the internet and device must be of Android Operating System.
 

#	External Interface Requirements

##	User Interfaces

The system is an Android App based system so, it will interact with its users with a device components interface. The users move through pages containing activities or directions to some other activities.
The system interface will look like following:

 

##	Hardware Interfaces

-	The system has no hardware interface requirements till -et.
-	For billing it will require somehow hardware interfaces -or bill scanning and all, but right now we haven’t used any -ardware interfaces.
-	Mobile’s Camera

##	Software Interfaces





###	Communications Interfaces

The SCM system will use TCP/IP as the main communication protocol through the internet/network.

Also, it might communicate with external systems in the future, such as customer relationship management systems and HR systems. The scope of our system does not require us to interact with other interfaces, but it can be customized.   
###	System Features
This section of the SRS describes the requirements for the system’s features. Specifically, requirements for component functionality, data curation, and software system administration are defined.

###	Volatile Data Stream
The VDS component of the software system must comply with all enumerated requirements for an application to execute an MTConnect Agent (Data Exchange Between Shop Floor equipment and a software application used for monitoring and data analysis) in the standard.

###	Query-able Data Repository
The QDR component of the software system must retrieve data from an indexed database based on a user-defined query request via an app user interface, an endpoint query, and/or an API call.

-	The QDR must provide the administrator with the ability to predefine queries for use by non-administrator users.
-	The QDR must enable the administrator to limit query results by date ranges and/or several records.
-	When configured in a query by the administrator, the QDR must provide the user with a list of all available devices in the database and all available associated data elements for that device.
-	The user may be provided the ability to select what data elements to retrieve via the predefined query.
-	The user must have the ability to select the time range and/or several records for the data to retrieve via the query.
-	The user must have the ability to retrieve and view data as formatted ASCII, CSV, JSON, Pdf, or XML.



###	Data Curation
This subsection of the SRS describes the requirements for data curation within the software system.

-	The software system must provide a function to store and manage data in a database according to a data-structure template (e.g., schema, ontology).











#	Other Non-functional Requirements

## Performance Requirements
The system must handle concurrent users and their operations. The system must accomplish of transactions. This is due to the nature of data, which is only text information that does not usually exceed 50 KB per transaction.


## Safety Requirements
There are no requirements for Mean Time between Failures (MTBF) or Mean Time to Failures (MTTF) for this version of the software system defined in this SRS. However, in accordance with industry recommended practices, the software system should undergo feature testing, load testing, and regression testing are prior to releasing and/or deployment.

## Availability Requirements
Reasonable efforts should be made to ensure the software system is available with an uptime of 95%. The uptime is calculated as the percentage of time during the year in which the software system was available to the public. A 95% uptime percentage allows for an average of 18.25 days per year, 36 hours per month, or 8.4 hours per week of downtime.

## Security Requirements
The software system defined in this SRS must follow industry-recommended practices for secure software development. At a minimum, the software development must practice the principle of least privilege for defining access-level requirements of the software system and its associated services. The production-release version of the software system must pass an automated dynamic application security testing tool.

The system has only three roles for coordinators (Admin), suppliers, and customers only that make our system secure access online and these authentications will prevent and illegal access.

## Maintainability Requirements
The architecture, design, implementation, and documentation of the application must minimize the maintenance costs of the software system. The maximum person-time required to fix a security defect (including regression testing and documentation update) must not exceed two person days. Otherwise, the software system must be taken offline or the offending feature disabled. The average person-time required to make a minor enhancement (including testing and documentation update) must not exceed one person per week.

The system is designed in modules where errors can be detected and fixed easily. This makes it easier to install updates and new functionality if required.




## Portability
The system can operate in any of the latest Android operating systems with the latest version. Due to the nature of the system, the host machine must also have Android installed.


## Business Model
The system must have at least a Super-User role and a user role defined for accessing and interacting with the system. Additional roles may be defined for the system if the business rules for the administrator and user roles are satisfied. At a minimum, the Super-User role must account for the data explorer, data curator, and administrator account type requirements described in Section.

At a minimum, the User role must account for the data explorer account-type requirements described in Section.



The following business rules must apply to the administrator and user roles.

### Super-User Role Business Rules 

-	Superuser Role/001 Maintains all VDS and QDR back-end system configurations 
-	Superuser Role/002 Maintains all VDS and QDR schemas and templates
-	Maintains all user groups and user accounts
-	Maintains all QDR predefined queries

### User Role Business Rules

-	Connects to and retrieves and reads data from VDS and QDR in conformance with the maintained VDS and QDR schemas and templates.
 

###	Other Requirements
-	Up to now there is not any legal requirements from government.
